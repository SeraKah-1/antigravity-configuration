## 📦 Archived Logs Summary (Session: 297b024a, 2026-06-14)

Setup phase completed. Key decisions made through competitive research:

1. **PA-SDLC 5-Fase** workflow created and integrated into `CLAUDE.md`.
2. **3 Subagents** defined: `ui-designer`, `qa-engineer`, `code-simplifier`. Rejected skill-file bloat (validated by analyzing `antigravity-awesome-skills` — 1,550 skills, even they warn against full install).
3. **Best practices imported** from `addyosmani/agent-skills` (Explicit Assumptions, Anti-Rationalization, Verification Gates) and `obra/superpowers` (Atomic Planning). Rejected their overengineered structures.
4. **MCP servers researched** (GitHub, Vercel, Figma, Firebase, Penpot, Composio, NotebookLM). All **deferred** — too rigid/fragile for our pragmatic workflow. Will revisit only when a real project demands specific integration.
5. **Credentials** stored in `.env` (git-ignored). Repo pushed to `SeraKah-1/antigravity-configuration`.

## ⏱️ Recent Action Log

*   **2026-06-14T10:55:00Z | Feat: Real-Time Token Monitor Web Dashboard**
    *   *Actions:* (1) Built a lightweight Node.js/Express backend that watches CLI session transcripts. (2) Designed an industrial/cyberpunk dark-theme frontend using Chart.js to graph token growth dynamically. (3) Wrote `token-monitor-dashboard.sh` launcher and integrated dashboard symlinking/deployment into `install.sh`. (4) Validated API endpoints and pushed code to GitHub.
*   **2026-06-14T10:45:00Z | Test: Token Monitor & Installer Verification**
    *   *Actions:* (1) Executed `token-monitor.sh` to trace estimated tokens (~276k full transcript, 467 steps) and verify model change tracking. (2) Ran `install.sh` to test single-command setup workflow (cloning, symlinking, and env stubbing). Everything succeeded.
*   **2026-06-14T10:30:00Z | Refactor: Address Claude's Critique**
    *   *Actions:* (1) Compacted session_state.md to fix policy violation. (2) Made CLAUDE.md portable (no hardcoded paths). (3) Added situational exception to frontend-design skill. (4) Created `install.sh` for single-command setup on any device/user.

## 📋 Next Tasks
1.  Wait for user's development prompt to build a real project.
2.  Execute PA-SDLC workflow on that project to prove effectiveness.
