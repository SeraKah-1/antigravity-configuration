## 📦 Archived Logs Summary (Session: 297b024a, 2026-06-14)

Setup phase completed. Key decisions made through competitive research:

1. **PA-SDLC 5-Fase** workflow created and integrated into `CLAUDE.md`.
2. **3 Subagents** defined: `ui-designer`, `qa-engineer`, `code-simplifier`. Rejected skill-file bloat (validated by analyzing `antigravity-awesome-skills` — 1,550 skills, even they warn against full install).
3. **Best practices imported** from `addyosmani/agent-skills` (Explicit Assumptions, Anti-Rationalization, Verification Gates) and `obra/superpowers` (Atomic Planning). Rejected their overengineered structures.
4. **MCP servers researched** (GitHub, Vercel, Figma, Firebase, Penpot, Composio, NotebookLM). All **deferred** — too rigid/fragile for our pragmatic workflow. Will revisit only when a real project demands specific integration.
5. **Credentials** stored in `.env` (git-ignored). Repo pushed to `SeraKah-1/antigravity-configuration`.
