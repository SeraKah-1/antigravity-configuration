## ⏱️ Action Log (Session: 297b024a)

*   **2026-06-14T09:20:00Z | Setup: Skills**
    *   *Action:* Created [CLAUDE.md](file:///home/ayintaput/CLAUDE.md) defining `frontend-design` and `simplify` skills.
    *   *Artifact:* Created [setup_skills.md](file:///home/ayintaput/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/297b024a-4cb8-4361-b73a-be1ab3490127/setup_skills.md).
*   **2026-06-14T09:32:00Z | Research: SOTA Agents**
    *   *Action:* Researched multi-agent patterns. Defined subagents: `ux-architect`, `code-builder`, `refactoring-auditor`.
    *   *Artifact:* Created [agent_research.md](file:///home/ayintaput/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/297b024a-4cb8-4361-b73a-be1ab3490127/agent_research.md).
*   **2026-06-14T09:35:00Z | Refinement: QA Agent & Grill**
    *   *Action:* Grilled workflow. Retired redundant `code-builder`. Added `qa-engineer` (test-qa skill).
    *   *Defined Subagents:* `ui-designer`, `qa-engineer`, `code-simplifier`.
*   **2026-06-14T09:43:00Z | Integration: PA-SDLC Workflow**
    *   *Action:* Added 5-Fase PA-SDLC cycle to `CLAUDE.md`.
    *   *Artifact:* Created [workflow_guide.md](file:///home/ayintaput/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/297b024a-4cb8-4361-b73a-be1ab3490127/workflow_guide.md).
*   **2026-06-14T09:44:00Z | Policy: Challenge Assumptions**
    *   *Action:* Added "Challenge Assumptions (XY Problem)" rule to Fase 1 in `CLAUDE.md` and `workflow_guide.md`.
*   **2026-06-14T09:49:00Z | Memory: Session State Log**
    *   *Action:* Initialized [session_state.md](file:///home/ayintaput/session_state.md) to serve as a memory anchor.

---

*   **2026-06-14T09:50:00Z | Integration: Master Rules & Clean Setup**
    *   *Action:* Performed comprehensive audit. Unified [CLAUDE.md](file:///home/ayintaput/CLAUDE.md) as the single SOTA behavior contract. Integrated error handling policies (Good vs Bad), naming conventions, and compaction rules.

---

*   **2026-06-14T09:57:00Z | Deployment: Push Configuration to GitHub**
    *   *Action:* Saved username and PAT to local `.env` and home `.env`. Created `.gitignore` to prevent secret exposure. Set up authenticated remote URL locally and successfully pushed all configuration assets (`CLAUDE.md`, `session_state.md`, `brain/*`) to GitHub.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:02:00Z | Discovery: Competitor Repo Analysis (agent-skills)**
    *   *Action:* Cloned and analyzed `addyosmani/agent-skills`. Identified it as overengineered for our fast workflow due to excessive `SKILL.md` overhead and manual slash command gates.
    *   *Decision:* Retained our lightweight SOTA PA-SDLC workflow + subagents but imported their best practices: "Explicit Assumption Listing", "Anti-Rationalization", and "Verification Gates" into `CLAUDE.md`.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:05:00Z | Discovery: Competitor Repo Analysis (superpowers)**
    *   *Action:* Cloned and analyzed `obra/superpowers`. Identified it as overly bureaucratic (mandating git worktrees and spawning disposable subagents for every tiny task). Their `CLAUDE.md` is merely a defensive list of PR rules, not a workflow contract.
    *   *Decision:* Rejected their heavy git-worktree model. Adopted their best practice of "Atomic Planning" (breaking down plans into bite-sized tasks before coding) and added it to Phase 1 in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:09:00Z | Research: MCP Servers Evaluation**
    *   *Action:* Researched SOTA MCP servers (GitHub, Vercel, Figma, Firebase).
    *   *Artifact:* Created [mcp_research.md](file:///home/ayintaput/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/297b024a-4cb8-4361-b73a-be1ab3490127/mcp_research.md).
    *   *Decision:* Prioritized Figma MCP for `ui-designer`. Deemed GitHub and Vercel MCPs as high value. Firebase MCP depends on the chosen tech stack.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:14:00Z | Discovery: ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills Analysis**
    *   *Action:* Cloned and analyzed the `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills` repo.
    *   *Findings:* The repo differentiates MCP (transport/auth), Tools (functions), and Skills (workflows). It provides the `connect-apps` plugin via Composio to access 78+ SaaS apps instantly. It also includes an `mcp-builder` skill that teaches AI how to build optimal MCP servers in Python/TypeScript.
    *   *Decision:* Integrated the conceptual difference between Skills vs. MCP into our understanding. We can use Composio if we need instant connection to hundreds of apps without building MCPs from scratch.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:17:00Z | Analysis: NotebookLM MCP Server**
    *   *Action:* Cloned and analyzed `jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli`.
    *   *Findings:* An MCP server that reverse-engineers Google's NotebookLM internal API to allow AI agents to manage notebooks, upload sources, query data, and generate audio overviews.
    *   *Decision (Pragmatic):* High risk. It relies on undocumented, fragile APIs and requires manual browser cookie extraction which expires. Should be AVOIDED for stable production workflows, unless massive document/audio RAG synthesis is the core feature requirement and we accept the maintenance overhead.

---

*   **2026-06-14T10:19:00Z | Discovery: Antigravity Awesome Skills (AAS)**
    *   *Action:* Cloned and analyzed `sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`.
    *   *Findings:* A massive repository containing 1,550+ `SKILL.md` playbooks/prompts. It warns against installing the entire catalog and suggests using "Specialized Plugins" (subset of skills) to avoid blowing up the context window. 
    *   *Decision (Pragmatic):* Validates our current architecture. Instead of polluting the workspace with hundreds of Markdown files (which the agent must read and decide when to trigger), our PA-SDLC uses dedicated Subagents with strict System Prompts and a single `CLAUDE.md` controller. We achieve the same domain-specific focus as their "Specialized Plugins" but with zero token bloat. No need to adopt their repository.
